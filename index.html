<div class="paragraph"><p style="font-size:18px">We are a small family-run local business, operating in Hulkstown since 2012, hoping to improve our business by getting on the Internet. 
We create custom cosplay and fancy dress costumes and run a monthly cosplay party. We get about 30 people to the parties each month and make about 4 costumes per week – not enough. The website should help us be more successful at these. Dressing up is fun, good for the socially awkward and very creative. 
We get cosplayers of all ages, but mostly they are 35 – 50. We want the site to appeal to a younger audience than this, getting high school kids and young adults cosplaying. We think more people would come to the parties and get costumes made if they knew about us more… so we want a website!

Cosplay, a portmanteau of the words costume play, is a performance art in which participants called cosplayers wear costumes and fashion accessories to represent a specific character. Cosplayers often interact to create a subculture and a broader use of the term "cosplay" applies to any costumed role-playing in venues apart from the stage. Any entity that lends itself to dramatic interpretation may be taken up as a subject and it is not unusual to see genders switched. Favorite sources include manga and anime, comic books and cartoons, video games, and live-action films and television series.

<p style="font-size:18px">

The rapid growth in the number of people cosplaying as a hobby since 1990 has made the phenomenon a significant aspect of popular culture in Japan and some other parts of Asia and in the Western world. Cosplay events are common features of fan conventions and there are also dedicated conventions and local and international competitions, as well as social networks, websites and other forms of media centered on cosplay activities.

Party fees must be paid at the door. Cash or EFTPOS accepted. Credit card payments attract a 2% surcharge. Alcohol is served at the bar to over 18s only. No intoxicated persons will be served, but will be escorted to a taxi – paid by the party-goer.</p>
